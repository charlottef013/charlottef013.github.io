	<h1>Pizza</h1>
	<hr>
	<p> Pizza is one of the older dishes in this list. There are traces of flatbreads with toppings in ancient greece, rome, and egypt. It was officially created in Naples from the 16th-18th centuries. This is one example of a dish that shows us different times in history. Pizza also brings people together. It allows you to have any toppings you want and to mix it up. One of the nearly constants of pizza is cheese which is one of my favorites. Althoug, you can also get it without cheese, if that what you prefer. </p>
