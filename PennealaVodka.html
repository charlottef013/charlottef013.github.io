	<h1>Penne alla Vodka</h1>
	<hr>
	<p> It is belived that Penne alla vodka was invented in the 1970s atthe restaurant Orsini in new york or in Italy. Some chefs are certain that it was created in Italy before it gained popularity in the United states. If you want a warm bite of delisiousness Penne a la Vodka is the way to go. It is a tomato sauce with cream and Vodka. The alcohol gets burt off during cooking and leaves a distinct flavor and smell. It can be paired with any pasta but is typically with penne. </p>
